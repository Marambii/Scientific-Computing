## Datatypes 
#### Has a list of different datatypes that can be used in pyhton. 

## Control Structures
#### These are structures that help in making logical decisions. The is even function checks if a number is even by checking if it has a remanider when divided by 2. if it has a remainder it is concidered odd. The for loop generates a list of the even numbers from 1 to 50 by using the ~for in range~. A while loop prints the numers 10 down to 1

## Modular functions
#### The calculate area function takes in shape, and 2 dimensions as parameters and uses if else statements to make detailed decisions on which block to be used. 


#### From these excercise i have learnt how to effectively use control structures and datatypes to perform modular programming
